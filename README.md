Data preprocessing and classification of tweets with Naive-Bayes and neural networks

The main goal of this project is to build ML models to classify each tweet wether it was about a disaster or not.
Some of the tweets are...

> Just got sent this photo from Ruby #Alaska as smoke from #wildfires pours into a school

or...

> 9 Mile backup on I-77 South...accident blocking the Right 2 Lanes at Exit 31 Langtree Rd...consider NC 115 or NC 150 to NC 16 as  alternate

Many tweets contains typical keywords such as *wildfire* of *accident* indicating the sentiment of the tweet.
